# TailNuxt template

This is a nuxtjs port of the tailnext.js template. 

This was my first attempt to translate an existing template from react to vue, so there may be some errors. Pull requests are welcome. 

# Built from Scratch - Nuxt3 with tailwindcss

This repo was built from scratch. 

If you just want to use the Tailnuxt template, simply clone this repo and build. 

If you don't want to use this template but want to build Nuxt3 with Tailwindcss from scratch, here are the instructions. We used RC12 version of Nuxt3.

```
npx nuxi init nuxt-app
yarn add -D tailwindcss@latest postcss@latest autoprefixer@latest
yarn add -D @nuxtjs/tailwindcss
yarn dev
```

Edit `nuxt.config.ts` to be: 

```// https://v3.nuxtjs.org/api/configuration/nuxt.config
export default defineNuxtConfig({
      buildModules: ['@nuxtjs/tailwindcss']
})
```

Then, do the following: 

- remove App.vue
- create pages directory
- add index.vue and your vue content accordingly.
